## React
We have chosen React as our front end JavaScript Library. In fact, according to Stack Overflow developer annual survey, React.js (40.14%) has overtaken jQuery (34.42%) to become the most-used web framework. Besides, React.js (25.12%) also leads the most-wanted web frameworks, followed by Vue.js (16.69%), Django (9.21%), Angular (8.47%), and Svelte (6.57%).

First we are creating the react app by using npx, npm package runner: npx create-react-app new-app and move into the directory folder cd new-app To work with algorand we need algosdk dependency and to make our life easier with html elements later we also install semantic-ui-react. npm i algosdk semantic-ui-react
